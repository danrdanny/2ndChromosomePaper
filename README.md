Files used to analyze VCF files in The Molecular and Genetic Characterization of Second Chromosome Balancers in Drosophila melanogaster. Questions? Please contact Danny at dem {at} stowers {dot} org.

The scripts require you to have vcf files in directories with the same name as the stocks used in the study. For example, the file CyO-2.vcf.gz must exist within the CyO-2 directory. Stocks used in this study are:
